## Description

Address security vulnerabilities and prepare the contract for professional audit. Current implementation has several security concerns that need immediate attention.

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Withdrawal Logic Flaws
**Current Issue**: In `withdraw_from_campaign`, the contract approves tokens to the campaign owner, which is incorrect.
```cairo
// WRONG: Contract cannot approve on behalf of itself
let approve = token.approve(campaign_owner, campaign.target_amount);

// CORRECT: Direct transfer
let transfer = token.transfer(campaign_owner, campaign.target_amount);
```

### 2. Reentrancy Protection
```cairo
component!(path: ReentrancyGuardComponent, storage: reentrancy_guard, event: ReentrancyGuardEvent);

// Add to sensitive functions
#[reentrancy_guard]
fn withdraw_from_campaign(ref self: ContractState, campaign_id: u256) {
    // ... withdrawal logic ...
}
```

### 3. Input Validation
- Check for zero addresses in all functions
- Validate array lengths to prevent DoS
- Add overflow checks for arithmetic operations
- Validate token addresses against whitelist

### 4. Access Control Improvements
```cairo
// Add role-based access control
enum Role {
    Admin,
    Moderator,
    Pauser,
}

// Implement pausable functionality
fn pause(ref self: ContractState) // Admin only
fn unpause(ref self: ContractState) // Admin only
```

### 5. State Consistency Checks
- Ensure campaign state transitions are valid
- Prevent duplicate operations (double withdrawal, double refund)
- Add invariant checks after state changes

### 6. Event Security
- Add indexed fields for efficient filtering
- Include all relevant data in events
- Emit events before external calls

## Security Checklist
- [ ] Fix withdrawal logic to use transfer instead of approve
- [ ] Implement reentrancy guards on all external functions
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker (pause/unpause)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for campaign creation
- [ ] Validate all external contract calls
- [ ] Implement proper access control
- [ ] Add emergency withdrawal mechanism
- [ ] Ensure no integer overflow/underflow
- [ ] Validate all state transitions

## Audit Preparation
- [ ] Complete security fixes
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Write security test suite
- [ ] Create threat model document
- [ ] Implement formal verification where possible
- [ ] Add slither/mythril configuration

## Technical Notes
- Follow checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Use pull over push for payments
- Implement timelock for admin functions
- Consider implementing a bug bounty program
