## Getting Started

1. Review issues based on your priorities
2. Start with critical safety features (#010)
3. Implement core enhancements
4. Add advanced features incrementally
5. Ensure comprehensive testing

## Integration Examples

### Salary Streaming
```cairo
// Create monthly salary stream with auto-renewal
create_salary_stream(
    employee: employee_address,
    config: SalaryConfig {
        amount_per_period: 5000_000000, // $5000 USDC
        pay_frequency: PayFrequency::Monthly,
        start_date: get_block_timestamp(),
        allow_advance: true,
        max_advance_percentage: 2000, // 20%
    },
    token: usdc_address
)
```

### Multi-Recipient Distribution
```cairo
// Split revenue among team members
create_split_stream(
    recipients: [
        (alice_address, 4000), // 40%
        (bob_address, 3500),   // 35%
        (carol_address, 2500), // 25%
    ],
    total_amount: 100000_000000,
    duration: 30, // days
    token: usdc_address
)
```
